About Online Railway Reservation System PHP Project
In particular, this Railway Management System Project in PHP focuses mainly on managing online train tickets. To be more precise, the system helps to keep track of all online ticket bookings and information. Also, the system displays all the available passengers and routes. In addition, the system allows adding up train, and ticket details too(codeastro.com). Evidently, this project contains an admin panel with an employee and passenger panel. In an overview of this web application, passengers can simply register themselves and log into the system in order to book online tickets. He/she can view a list of available trains with their routes, fares, and others respectively. With it, passengers can book trains by selecting any. For this, the passenger has to check out the online train reservation by providing a payment code. At last, the passengers can view their tickets from the ticket section.

Before anything, this whole online ticket reservation process from a passenger’s account is not considered to be finalized by the system. Meaning, the tickets are set to pending status by default, which requires approval from the system administrator. From the ticket section, passenger can also print their tickets. Besides, the passengers can cancel their tickets anytime. Also, the users can view, and update their profiles.

Admin Panel
An admin has full control over the system. He/she can manage passengers, trains, accounting, and so on. Here, each and every section has its own respective details such as name, and other important details. Here, an admin can add passenger records directly by filling up the required forms. During the passenger registration, an admin has to provide details such as name, address, contact, and set up login details. The administrator can also manage employee members for the system(codeastro.com). For adding an employee, the user has to provide names, and positions, and set up login credentials. Talking about the reservations, an administrator can view all the passenger’s reservation lists from his/her dashboard. Which also highlights all the important details such as names, routes, times, fares, total passengers, and more.

Train Management
When it comes to projects such as the Online Train Ticket Booking System, it’s a must that it should contain a section to cover train details too. And there is one. For this online train ticket system project, the administrator can manage train records easily. Not just with ease, but also it helps to cover up all the important and required information for the system. In order to add train details, the administrator has to provide a number of details. Such as the name of the train with the train number, route, fare, total seats/passengers, departure time, and more. Here, each and every train must have its own unique train number(codeastro.com). Besides, the administrator can view, update, and delete train details. And also, the system users can view and print the train details.

Train Ticket Management
Moreover, the tickets section is divided into three categories, Pending, Approved, and Management. As mentioned earlier, all the confirmed payments from the passenger’s ticket reservation are stored here for the admin’s approval. Here, the administrator can view a list of pending tickets with details such as the name of the passenger with his/her booking details. This particular section ties directly to the accounting section for the calculation of total ticket sales. After approval from the admin, the details are forwarded to the approved tickets section(codeastro.com). The admin can view payment codes from each and every passenger’s ticket reservations. In short, an admin has to mark and confirm the payment manually. Now talking about train ticket management, this section is where the administrator can either update the ticket details or delete the train ticket reservations
